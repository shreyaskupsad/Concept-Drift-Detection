# Concept-Drift-Detection
Developed a model-agnostic approach to detect concept drift, which involves changes in the relationships between input features and the target variable, potentially degrading machine learning model performance.
Leveraged SHAP values, permutation importance, and Model Class Reliance (MCR) bounds to identify and
interpret drift across various models. The research confirmed that changes in feature importance and SHAP
values are reliable indicators of concept drift. However, challenges such as detecting statistically significant
shifts and gradual drift were identified, highlighting areas for future refinement. The methodology
contributes to maintaining model accuracy in dynamic environments through proactive intervention.
